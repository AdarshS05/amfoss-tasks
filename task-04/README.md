# Competitive Programming

This challenge felt quite difficult in the beginning since I didnt know much about how to write efficiant programs. I did one of the problems (Ethreal Quest) in C as I was learning C back then, and didnt know about python loops. By the time I started the other tasks, we were learning python in college as well so they felt relatively easier.
