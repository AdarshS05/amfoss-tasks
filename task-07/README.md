This challenge was a bit difficult at the beginning but very rewarding at the end. It had a lot of experimenting, and I personally learnt a lot of things, like running a javascript, how url id's work and creating extentions for chrome. 

I had no idea where to start from, so I searched up google for some help. I first created a manifest.json file which was mainly used to create details for the chrome extention. Next I worked on the html and css part using VScode. Lastly I worked on the script.js file, which I had many issues with. The code didnt seem to run for a few days, but the error got fixed when I redid by code and fixed the js and html files
