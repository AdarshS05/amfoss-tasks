# Vim

I started this task during the last week, in between the main tasks that I was doing. It was quite a stress reliever, to be honest. I installed Vim from the Linux terminal and ran the command vimtutor. When I first attempted to save the Vimtutor file using the :wq command, the file didn't save. So, I created a copy of Vimtutor 1.7 in my amfoss-tasks repository. I found using the hjkl keys much faster than scrolling or using the arrow keys. The x command and using the ESC key were a bit confusing at first, but I didn't have any other major issues completing the tutorial.
