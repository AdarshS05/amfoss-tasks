This was a difficult task for me. Though I could not fully finish this challenge it helped me learn a lot of things about web scraping, and making discord bots. I started by creating a venv and installed the requirements.txt file in it. I created a discord application in the developer portal and gave it the permissions required to read/send messages. I saved the BOT TOKEN in a .env file. 

For creating the scraper.py while inspecting the html elements it was quite tricky to find the class of the live scores of the current match. I added the attributes for score of team1, team2, livescore and date. For creating the bot.py I imported discord, csv, and dotenv. However the bot.py files had a few errors with the code so I could not run it. I tried to resolve most of the issues but due to the lack of time I wasnt able to finish.
