This challenge was quite interesting and fun as well. Got to learn a lot more about HTML functions and CSS. 

I had a few issues with positioning the text and images, mostly when I tried opening it with different browsers, zoomed in and zoomed out, mimimised and maximised. Also had an issue with transfering/renaming the html and css files making the code not work properly so had created an assets folder for all the images used as well.

Using VS Code I first created a file called landingpage.html. I looked at google to understand how the HTML coding works. I then created a page which codes for the CSS in the landing page. As I didnt know much about how we position images/text I set a fixed/absolute position for all elements individually. I then created a button for the shop page and created the same on another html file. I similarly created a shop.css file which I used to code for all the items individually. Some errors were made and rectified in the allignment and sizes.
