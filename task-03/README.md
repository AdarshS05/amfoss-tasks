# Hello World

I was totally confused on how to approach this task. Since we had learned python fundamentals in the first few weeks, I started off with writing the program in python. There were different ways to approach this problem, but I used the concept of loops which felt simple and quick. I learned C basics from codechef recently too, so I could make up a corresponding C code as well. C++ was very similar to C, except how the stetements were printed and scanned. Go was also similar to C in many ways, but you had to import the fmt module. For Java and JS the approach had to be done a bit differently which was confusing. Ruby also was a bit hard to understand however the code format was similar to the python as well. For elxir and rust I couldnt complete it fully, as the files kept having errors when excecuting in the linux terminal. Lastly for haskell I couldnt understand how and what should we write the code. At the end I could only succesfully do 7 out of the 10 programming languages in Linux.
